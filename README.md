# Features:
* 3D MODELS! - I implemented 3d models for over 100 pokemon using three.js and a repo I will link below
* PokemonAPI usage - for pokemon I do no have models for I show an image from the pokemon api
* Pokemon types - each pokemon has its types displayed, click them to see their family!
* Responsive - Works on mobile with touch support!

# Downside of using three.js
* Since it has to load models which may be complex, it can take some time to load for instance my Bulbasaur model is 50mb! so it takes a while especially on mobile
* Models are hard to make, and usually take a whole team to make them, if the models were not open source I couldn't have done this
